Hello and welcome to my GitHub,

Let me introduce myself: I’m Raymond van Hoorn (aka ray2day) C# / .NET developer and graphic designer. In this file you can read how I retrained and became a professional C# / .NET programmer. I'm trying to keep it compact, but like my career it's expanding every day.

In December 2021 I graduated post bachelor C# programming at Avans+ hoge school in 's-Hertogenbosch. Since I am improving my C# and .NET coding skills.

In May 2022 I started gaining workexperience by working as backend developer in a team on a project of social interest for a half year. Next to gaining work experience, I got the opportunity to obtain more certificates in programming like the Professional Scrum Master exam (PSMI) in June 2022.

In January 2023 I started self-study again. Improving my skills, mainly focused on expanding my C# skills and my ASP.NET knowledge including studying for the Pearson IT MTA: 98-361 Software Development Fundamentals-exam. Next to that a lot of hobby C# programming (ASP.NET, Console apps and WinForms).

What involves my graphic background: I am an expert in Adobe Indesign, Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF-workflow. Also a specialist in the printing industry (pre-press) with an enormous practical experience and knowledge of offset-, silk screen- and digital printing. Next to that I lots of experience in packaging / and setting up color management and print production planning systems and workflows. My strenght is my technical knowledge and interest.

In former graphic jobs technical side tasks were often handed to me: creating work-arounds, automate processes and find efficient ways to work using the software available. At EMI Compact Disc I was involved in an IT project group to automate and implement the graphical process from customer to production in SAP. At my last graphic job I automated almost all of the imposition processes for digital printing. 

My hobbies are: scuba diving, hiking, cats and MSX (retro) computers (collecting, playing games and of course coding). My retro computer- and programming hobby has lead me to retrain to and become a professional programmer.



As far earlier coding experiences concerned I have a history in:
- coding plain HTML, CSS / later assisted with development tools (e.g. Adobe Dreamweaver) in former jobs
- coding in MSX-BASIC and a little Z80-assembly on real hardware also emulated using Open MSX / Visual Studio Code as hobby



**As far learning C# coding / .NET development concerned I RECENTLY HAVE DONE:**
- in the beginning I started off with the (101) basics and most of the Microsoft Docs learning myself coding- and debugging using Visual Studio, I did a lot of SELF STUDY from diverse sources and mainly internet (YouTube and Udemy) as also books 'Zie Scherp' and the follow-up 'Zie Scherper'(object oriented programming C# for advanced, enthusiasts and geeks) / Tim Dams worked out completely including excercises.
- a friend (programmer) educated me in version control, using Git and GitHub. I learned to work with Git / GitHub using it for my own projects (as you can see I have built up a quite nice library of repositories) and later by working in a team using Git in combination with Azure DevOps
- soon this was followed by an offical college course in programming;
>> Avans+ post bachelor (HBO):</BR>
• C# programming (graduated - certificate of participation and assessment)
- in between I spent more time self study;
>> Udemy courses (all certificate of completion):</BR>
• C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding</BR>
• C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP</BR>
• C# Developers: Double Your Coding Speed with Visual Studio</BR>
• Complete Guide to ASP.NET Core RESTful API with Blazor WASM</BR>
• Modern Web Development with Blazor WebAssembley</BR>
• Programming in Blazor ASP.NET Core 5</BR>

• Restful API with .NET Core (.NET7)</BR>
• Complete Agile Scrum Master Certification Training</BR>
• 98-361: Software Development Fundamentals (using C#)</P>

- at BEE-ideas: I am gained work experience as backend developer in a team on a project of social interest working with Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code, Angular, Typescript, Node JS, C#, .NET, SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Devops, Swagger, Git, Agile/Scrum etc.</BR>
>> Scrum:</BR>
• Professional Scrum Master (PSM I) (certificate)</P>

Other courses</BR>
• C# Test-Driven development, Introduction to ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5), Learn ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6), Building a .NET 6 API Using TDD and The Bowling Game Kata</P>

Other
- learned the basics of working assistive tools like Postman and other third party tools like Toastr, Syncfusion
- a lot of practicing, a lot of exercises and built some (hobby) applications of my own
- also I am having conversations with professionals in the workfield to help me to choose my path in coding


**As far learning C# coding / .NET development concerned I am BUSY WITH:**
- expanding my C# coding skills by doing tutorials, excercises, etc. ...just programming a lot!</BR>
- expand my knowledge about developing webapps and -services using the .NET frame work; Razor pages / MVC / Blazor
- Udemy courses related to (advanced) C# OOP programming, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, WASM, Blazor
- learn even more about developing RESTful API's and Blazor applications
- learn more about Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio / managing and working with databases
- learn more about Azure DevOps / Active Directory / Authentication and Authorization
- keep having conversations with professionals in the workfield to help me to choose my path in coding

>> a Capacity Building traject by BEE-ideas founding (May 2022 - November 2022)

- gaining work experience and working in a team
- learn working with Azure DevOps
- improve my coding skills
- learn more about the SOLID-principles and Clean Coding and Test Driven Development


**As far learning C# coding / .NET development concerned I WANT TO / PLANNED TO learn & goals:**
- improve my C# and .NET skills even more...
- learn the ins- and outs of C# 11, NET 7 and Visual Studio 2022

>> find a challenging job in a quiet working environment where I can expand my knowledge and coding skills


**And if time left I would like to:**
- started with Angular basics (tour of heroes), perhaps learn more
- working with Xamarin / mono (building IOS / and other mobile applications)
- learn other programming languages (C++, Java)
- learn (more) about Xcode
