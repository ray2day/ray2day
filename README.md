Hello,

Let me introduce myself:</BR>
I’m Raymond van Hoorn (aka ray2day). Since the 80's I am using computers, starting with MSX (mid 80's), DOS PC's (late 80's) and after that (since the 90's) I mainly worked with Apple computers for my graphic profession.

At the moment my profession is still graphic designer/desktop publisher, but I am retraining to become a professional programmer. As for my
graphic design skills: I am a specialist using graphical software like Adobe Indesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. I am an expert on the encertified PDF-workflow; creating, editing and pre-flighting of PDF-documents using Adobe Acrobat Professional, Adobe Acrobat Distiller, Enfocus Pitstop and SAP/ready4print. I am also a specialist in the printing industry with and enormous practical experience and knowledge of offset-, silk screen- and digital printing. Also I have experience in packaging and setting up color management and print production planning systems and workflows. My strenght is my technical knowledge and interest.

Despite being a graphic designer, in my former jobs technical side tasks were often handed to me: creating work-arounds, automate processes and find efficient ways to work using the software available. For example working at EMI Compact Disc I was involved as graphic expert in an IT project group to automate and implement the graphical process from customer to production in SAP.

My hobbies: scuba diving, hiking, MSX computers (collecting, games and coding) and now coding in C# has become a great hobby.



As far earlier coding experiences concerned I have a history in:
- coding plain HTML, CSS / later assisted with development tools (e.g. Adobe Dreamweaver)
- coding in MSX-BASIC and a little Z80-assembly (hobby) also using Visual Studio Code)



**As far learning C# and .NET concerned I RECENTLY HAVE DONE:**
>> Avans+ post bachelor (HBO) collage education/course</BR>
• C# programming (graduated - certificate of participation and assessment)
- started off with Microsoft Docs related to C# and the .NET framework as also C# 101, .NET 101, C# Advanced 101, ASP.NET Core 101 and Blazor 101 series (and ofcourse followed through/worked out the excercises if there were any)
- learned to work (code and debug) with Visual Studio 2019
- self study from diverse sources and mainly the books 'Zie Scherp' (C# for beginners, enthusiasts and geeks) and 'Zie Scherper'(object oriented programming C# for advanced, enthusiasts and geeks) were a good guideline as also worked out excercises
>> Udemy courses related to C# programming and the .NET framework;</BR>
• C# Developers: Double Your Coding Speed with Visual Studio (certificate of completion)</BR>
• C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP (certificate of completion)</BR>
• Complete Guide to ASP.NET Core RESTful API with Blazor WASM (certificate of completion)</P>
- because of this last course I got a little taste of: working with Postman / Swagger UI / Entity framework / Razor pages / Blazor / API key- and (Jwt)Token Authentication / Identity Server 4 / Migration

>> LinkedIn Learn course related to C# programming and the .NET framework;</BR>
• C# Test-Driven Development</BR>
- practiced a lot and did a lot of of exercises (mainly focused on C#, ASP.NET and Blazor)
- having conversations with professionals in the workfield to help me to choose my path in coding
- a friend (professional programmer) has introduced me / and educated me to work with version control (git and GitHub)


**As far learning C# and .NET concerned I am BUSY WITH:**
- expanding my C# coding skills by reading (internet/books), tutorials, excercises, etc. ...and just programming a lot!</BR>
- learn to develop webapps and -services using the ASP.NET frame work; Razor pages / MVC / with main focus on Blazor (mainly self study)
- Udemy courses related to (advanced) C# OOP programming, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, WASM, Blazor, Xamarin Forms
- reading books like 'C# 9 and .Net 5 Modern Cross-Platform Development' and 'Handboek ASP.NET Core 3.1'
- having conversations with professionals in the workfield to help me to choose my path in coding
- share knowledge with fellow C# and .NET students through Discord
- getting used more working with git and GitHub
- getting used more working with Postman / Swagger UI
- learn more about API key- and (jwt)Token Authentication / Identity Server 4 / Migrating



**As far learning C# and .NET concerned I WANT TO / PLANNED TO learn & goals:**
- improve my C# and ASP.NET skills even more...
- a new postbachelor college education / advanced course C# (ASP.NET web forms, WASM and Blazor)
- learn the ins- and outs of C# 10, NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022
- want to do an official Scrumm / Agile course

>> find a great employer where I can have a great job in coding and expand my coding skills


**And if time left I would like to:**
- working with Xamarin / mono (building IOS / and other mobile applications)
- improve my Xcode skills
- lear more about Entity framework
- learn other programming languages
- learn C and C++
- learn Unity game development
- learn about Azure
