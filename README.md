Hello and welcome to my GitHub,

Let me introduce myself: I’m Raymond van Hoorn (aka ray2day). I am a Junior .NET developer and former graphic designer/desktop publisher. In December 2021 I graduated post bachelor C# programming at Avans hoge school (HBO). Next to that I have done, and am doing, a lot of self-study to improve my coding skills even more. At the moment mainly focused on ASP.NET building applications using MVC / Blazor web assembly. 

For my graphic skills: I am an expert using software like Adobe Indesign, Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF-workflow. Also a specialist in the printing industry with an enormous practical experience and knowledge of offset-, silk screen- and digital printing. Next to that I have a lot of experience in packaging and setting up color management and print production planning systems and workflows. My strenght is my technical knowledge and interest.

In former jobs technical side tasks were often handed to me: creating work-arounds, automate processes and find efficient ways to work using the software available. At EMI Compact Disc I was involved in an IT project group to automate and implement the graphical process from customer to production in SAP. At my current job I automated almost all of the imposition processes for digital printing. 

My hobbies are: scuba diving, cats, hiking and MSX (retro) computers (collecting, playing games and of course coding).<BR />My retro computer / programming hobby has lead me to retrain to and become a professional programmer.



As far earlier coding experiences concerned I have a history in:
- coding plain HTML, CSS / later assisted with development tools (e.g. Adobe Dreamweaver)
- coding in MSX-BASIC and a little Z80-assembly (hobby) on real hardware also emulated using Open MSX / Visual Studio Code



**As far learning C#, ASP.NET MVC and (Blazor) Web Assembly concerned I RECENTLY HAVE DONE:**
- started off with all the 101 basics, most of the Microsoft Docs and learned myself coding- and debugging with Visual Studio
- after that I did a lot of self study from diverse sources and mainly internet (YouTube and Udemy) as also books 'Zie Scherp' and the follow-up 'Zie Scherper'(object oriented programming C# for advanced, enthusiasts and geeks) / Tim Dams worked out completely including excercises, 'C# 9 and .Net 5 Modern Cross-Platform Development' and 'Handboek ASP.NET Core 3.1' / Michiel de Rond
- followed by an official college course in programming;
>> Avans+ post bachelor (HBO)</BR>
• C# programming (graduated - certificate of participation and assessment)
- and last period I spent my time with (more) self study;
>> Udemy courses</BR>
• C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding / Mosh Hamedani (certificate of completion)</BR>
• C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP / Mosh Hamedani (certificate of completion)</BR>
• C# Developers: Double Your Coding Speed with Visual Studio / Mosh Hamedani (certificate of completion)</BR>
• Complete Guide to ASP.NET Core RESTful API with Blazor WASM / Frank Liu (certificate of completion)</BR>
• Modern Web Development with Blazor WebAssembley / Trevoir Williams (certificate of completion)</P>
• Programming in Blazor ASP.NET Core 5 / Felipe Gavilán
• Blazor Bootcamp - .NET6 (WASM and Server) / Bhrugen Patel
Other courses</BR>
>>• C# Test-Driven development - LinkedIn Learning-tutorial / Christian Wenz (finished completely)</BR>
• Introduction to ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5) - free YouTube-tutorial / Bhrugen Patel (finished completely)</BR>
• Learn ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6) - free YouTube-tutorial / Bhrugen Patel (finished completely)</P>
- a friend (programmer) educated me version control, git and GitHub (you can see I have built up a quite nice library of repositories)
- learned the basics of working assistive tools like Postman / Swagger UI and other third party tools like Toastr, Syncfusion
- learned myself the basics of working with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- a lot of practicing, a lot of exercises and built some (hobby) applications of my own
- also I am having conversations with professionals in the workfield to help me to choose my path in coding


**As far learning C#, ASP.NET MVC and (Blazor) Web Assembly concerned I am BUSY WITH:**
- expanding my C# coding skills by doing tutorials, excercises, etc. ...just programming a lot!</BR>
- expand my knowledge about developing webapps and -services using the .NET frame work; Razor pages / MVC / Blazor
- Udemy courses related to (advanced) C# OOP programming, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, WASM, Blazor
- getting used even more working with git and GitHub (both using it in Visual Studio as working with it on the Command Line)
- learn even more about developing RESTful API's and Blazor applications
- learn more about Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio / managing and working with databases
- learn more about Authentication and Authorization (Duende and Identity Server 4)
- keep having conversations with professionals in the workfield to help me to choose my path in coding


**As far learning C#, ASP.NET MVC and (Blazor) Web Assembly concerned I WANT TO / PLANNED TO learn & goals:**
- improve my C# and ASP.NET skills even more... by starting a new (advanced) education/course
- or by getting real life work experience (because I am ready for it!)
- learn the ins- and outs of C# 10, NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022
- investigate Angular / React framework and view.js
- want to do an official Agile / Scrumm course

>> find a great employer where I can have a great job in coding and expand my coding skills


**And if time left I would like to:**
- working with Xamarin / mono (building IOS / and other mobile applications)
- learn other programming languages (C++, Java)
- learn (more) about Xcode
- learn to work with Azure DevOps
- learn Unity game development
